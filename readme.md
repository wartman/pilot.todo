Pilot Todo
----------

An example of how this silly thing ([Pilot](https://github.com/wartman/pilot)) might work.

Other Stuff
-----------

This example shows how Pilot can be used on both the client and the server with minimal configuration. It's not quite there yet -- I'm planning on adding some simple storage functionality -- but you can get the idea from looking at the structure of the app.

Other libraries used:

- [Pilot Cargo](https://github.com/wartman/pilot.cargo) (for data)
- [Capsule](https://github.com/wartman/capsule) (for dependency injection)
- [Tink Web](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_web) (for web stuff)
- [Tink](https://github.com/haxetink) (for basically everything, because it is cool)

Running
-------

Compile the app and run `node dist/index.js` in the console from the root folder. I'll add some real scripts later.
